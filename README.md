A provably human anonymous message board. Every voice is verified.

Arkora is a World App miniapp where users post, vote, and converse anonymously — but every account is backed by a unique World ID proof of humanity. No bots, no fake accounts, no duplicate identities. TikTok-style scroll feed, 4chan anonymity, Reddit boards structure — every voice cryptographically guaranteed real.

World ID Orb proofs are validated directly on World Chain via the WorldIDRouter smart contract — not on Worldcoin's centralized servers. Proof validation is settled by blockchain consensus.

**Features:** Posts + threaded replies · Sybil-resistant polls (1 verified human = 1 vote) · Human Karma & reputation tiers (shown in feed cards + profiles) · Post impressions (view count, deduped per verified human) · Confessions board (anonymous + verified) · Upvotes / downvotes · Vote reactions (see who liked/disliked) · Repost + quote-repost · In-app notifications (likes, quotes, reposts, replies, follows, DMs, tips, mentions) · Community Notes · Bookmarks · 40 boards with fuzzy search + dynamic creation · Multi-entity search (boards, people, posts) with prefix-first matching · Following feed · Local feed (GPS radius) · E2E encrypted DMs (with block enforcement) · @ mentions · Live ephemeral Rooms with Clubhouse-style participant grid + speaking indicators (auto-close when last person leaves) · Live rooms strip in main feed · Native share sheet on posts and rooms · Profile picture upload · Block / report / moderation (auto-hide at 5 reports) · WLD tips (with push notification to recipient) & subscriptions · Private Pusher channels (server-authorized) · Light + dark theme · GDPR-compliant account deletion (comprehensive data cleanup) · Privacy Policy + Terms of Service · **Public Developer API** (verified-human data, API key auth, CORS)

## Developer API

Arkora exposes a public REST API for accessing verified-human posts, polls, and stats. All data originates from World ID-verified accounts - no bots, no duplicates.

**Base URL:** `https://arkora.vercel.app/api/v1`

**Authentication:** Include your API key in every request:

```http
X-API-Key: ark_<your-key>
```

### Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| GET | `/v1/posts` | List posts. Params: `boardId`, `type`, `limit` (1-50), `cursor` |
| GET | `/v1/polls` | List polls with live vote counts. Params: `boardId`, `active=true`, `limit`, `cursor` |
| GET | `/v1/boards` | All boards with post counts |
| GET | `/v1/stats` | `totalPosts`, `totalPolls`, `totalVerifiedHumans`, `totalPollVotes` |

All responses: `{ success: true, data: [...], nextCursor: "..." | null }`

**Getting an API key:** Open Arkora in World App, go to Settings, scroll to "Developer API", and tap "New API key". You must be a World ID-verified user. Keys are prefixed `ark_` and shown once - copy immediately.

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

> **World App testing**: To test the full World ID flow you need World App on your phone. Use ngrok or Vercel Preview to expose a public URL, then update your Developer Portal redirect URL to match.

---

## Deployment (Vercel)

1. Push to GitHub and import the repo in the Vercel dashboard.
2. Add all environment variables from the table above.
3. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID` and `APP_ID` to your Worldcoin Developer Portal app ID.
4. Deploy.

**Developer Portal**: After deploying, update the **Redirect URL** in your Worldcoin Developer Portal to `https://your-domain.vercel.app`.

---

## Architecture

### Auth Flow

```
World App opens miniapp
  → WalletConnect auto-triggers walletAuth (MiniKit.commands.walletAuth)
  → User signs SIWE message in World App
  → POST /api/auth/wallet → verifies signature, issues httpOnly cookies:
      arkora-nh      (nullifierHash — the user's unique World ID identifier)
      wallet-address (EVM address)
  → Zustand store hydrates: isVerified=true, nullifierHash, user
```

World ID proof (Orb verification) is a separate step triggered by the user tapping "Verify & join" on the onboarding screen or "Verify with World ID" in the drawer. The proof is validated onchain via the WorldIDRouter contract on World Chain (no centralized API). The verification block number is stored and displayed in-app on profiles and in settings, with a link to worldscan.org.

### Identity Modes

Users choose how to appear:

| Mode | Description |
|---|---|
| **Random** | Fresh `Human #XXXX` tag each post (default, most anonymous) |
| **Alias** | Consistent user-chosen handle, persisted locally |
| **Named** | World ID username shown publicly |

### Feed Modes

| Mode | Description |
|---|---|
| **Curated** | Global feed, highest-ranked posts (server-cached, 30s TTL) |
| **Following** | Posts from followed users (requires auth) |
| **Local** | Posts near the viewer's GPS coordinates, filtered by radius |

### DMs

End-to-end encrypted. Key exchange uses ECDH (Curve25519); messages encrypted with AES-256-GCM. Public keys stored server-side. Private keys live only in Zustand / localStorage — the server never sees them. Block checks enforced server-side — blocked users cannot send or receive DMs. All DM Pusher channels are private (server-authorized).

### Security

Arkora underwent a comprehensive security audit (Sprint 19) across all layers — SQL injection, auth bypass, XSS/CSRF, rate limiting, secrets, headers, and infrastructure. Key properties:

- **No SQL injection**: All queries use Drizzle ORM parameterized builders — no raw SQL string interpolation anywhere in the codebase
- **Auth isolation**: Identity comes exclusively from the `arkora-nh` httpOnly cookie via `getCallerNullifier()`. Request body is never trusted for identity
- **CSRF mitigated**: `SameSite=Strict` on all auth cookies. No additional CSRF token layer required
- **World ID replay protection**: Enforced by the WorldIDRouter contract on World Chain — the EVM reverts on duplicate nullifier submissions
- **Input sanitization**: All user text passes through `sanitizeLine()` / `sanitizeText()` (NFKC normalization + HTML stripping) before DB writes
- **Private Pusher channels**: All per-user channels (`private-user-*`) require server-side authorization — prevents metadata snooping
- **CSP**: `unsafe-eval` removed from `script-src`. HSTS 2-year preload. COOP + X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies headers set
- **Constant-time nonce comparison**: SIWE nonce validation uses `crypto.timingSafeEqual()` to prevent timing oracle attacks
- **Rate limiting**: Per-endpoint, per-user sliding window. In-memory (per Vercel instance) — sufficient for early scale
- **Error messages**: World ID verification errors return generic messages to client; detailed errors logged server-side only
- **Atomic votes**: Vote operations use single CTE statements to prevent race conditions

For vulnerability reporting, see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

### Rate Limiting

In-memory sliding-window rate limiter (`lib/rateLimit.ts`). Per-Vercel-instance (sufficient for early scale). Key limits:
- Feed (`GET /posts`): 60 req/min per IP
- Post creation: 5 posts/min per user
- Replies, votes, search: similar per-user limits

### Decentralization

Arkora is being progressively decentralized across every layer of the stack:

| Layer | Status | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| **Identity** | Live | World ID Orb proofs validated onchain via WorldIDRouter on World Chain — no centralized identity API |
| **File storage** | Live | User-uploaded media stored on [Hippius](https://hippius.com), a decentralized S3-compatible service built on Bittensor subnet 14 |
| **Compute / platform** | Planned | Migrate core platform logic (feed, posts, moderation) to Bittensor subnet infrastructure — replacing centralized Vercel serverless functions with incentivized, decentralized compute |
| **Database** | Planned | Evaluate decentralized or verifiable data storage options as the platform matures |

The goal: a social platform where proof of humanity (World ID), content storage (Bittensor/Hippius), and application logic are all decentralized — no single operator can censor, surveil, or shut down the network.
